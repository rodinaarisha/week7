          <p>
            What is Beach Volleyball? Olympic beach volleyball is a team sport
            played by two players on each side of a sand court divided by a net.
            The objective of the game is to hit the ball - with hands or arms
            only over the net into the opponents court until the other side is
            unable to return the ball or the ball heads outside of the court
            lines. Each rally secures one point.
